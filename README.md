# Rust-Based CLI Todo List

This is my first *Rust* project as I learn this language.

I am implementing a basic CLI-app for a simple todo list.

## Build instructions

Make sure you have `rust` installed (`rustc` and `cargo`)

```bash
cargo clean
cargo build
target/debug/rustodo-cli <command> <OPTIONAL>
```

## Remaining Tasks

- [ ] Add CLI to the path so that can be accesssed anywhere - **IMPORTANT**
- [ ] Keep a list of `.todo` files for deletion purposes
- [ ] Create a new list with a `<name>`
