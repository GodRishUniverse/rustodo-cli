# Rust-Based CLI Todo List

This is my first *Rust* project as I learn this language.

I am implementing a basic CLI-app for a simple todo list.

## Build instructions

Make sure you have `rust` installed (`rustc` and `cargo`)

```bash
cargo clean
cargo build
target/debug/rustodo-cli <command> <OPTIONAL>
```
